                <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
                    <p>The dominance of mobile internet use means that users are searching for 
                        the right business as they travel, shop, or sit on their couch at home. 
                        Search Engine Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your visibility 
                        and find the right customers for your business.</p>

                <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
                    <p>The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media 
                        allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your 
                        business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential 
                        customers see when they search for your business. </p>

                       media marketing helps you determine which platforms are suited to your brand, 
                       using analytics to find the right markets and increase your lead generation.</p>
