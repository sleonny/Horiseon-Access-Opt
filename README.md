# Horiseon Semantic Sturcturing & Accessibility

## Description

The client wanted their website to meet accessibility standards
in order to be optimized for search engines.  I did this by
adding generous alt text to the images displayed in order to 
garner more search engine hits.  I noticed while doing so that 
the codebase did not follow acceptable semantic structuring.  I 
refactored the code in the index.html and style.css in order
to meet semantic structuring and consolidate unnecessary code. 
I also noticed a broken link in the header so I fixed the code
for that as well.
